# Deep-Sign-Language-Detection
Web App which performs sign language detection according to the American Sign Language standards. The model was trained using Deep Learning, specifically, an LSTM neural network, acheiving a test accuracy of 93%. 
Simply visit the link and click on Start to start the camera capturing, and you would be able to see the real-time predictions when you perform an action.

Here is an instance of the working of the model, where the sign language for 'hello' is shown and the model correctly predicts it. 
The probabilities of each sign language is being displayed at the left of the screen.
